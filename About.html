		<h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
			<p>Our mission is to spread our love of the sport of Taekwondo through the University of Toronto community. We run registered classes for people of all skill levels, from beginners to black belts. We strive to provide 
			a safe and fun environment for everyone to practice and refine their skills. Our competitive team also participates in tournaments against other universities. We also get together outside of training at our many socials, such as Pub Nights,
			Beach day, our annual trip to Hart House Farm, and more. Joining is a great way to meet people and make new friends. We are constantly trying to improve ourselves mentally, physically and socially.</p>
			<h6>OUR HISTORY</h6>
			<p>Originally the Trinity College Taekwondo Club, the club soon expanded to become campus wide. The University of Toronto Taekwondo Organization (UTTO) was created in 2006 by a group
			of Taekwondo enthusiasts and practitioners. Before the club, there had not been any real or proper attempt to offer a qualified level of instruction to the students. Accordingly, the
			interest in Taekwondo was lost and not accommodated. The founding group members realized that there lacked a dedicated club that seriously understood or demonstrated the physical and
			mental discipline of the sport and art. Thus, with such thoughts in mind, the founding members of UTTO strove to offer a strong focus on safety, self-defence, fitness, physical self-control,
			and mental discipline to all club members. </p>
			<h6>ABOUT TAEKWONDO</h6>
			<p><strong>Taekwondo</strong> is a Korean martial art. In addition to being the national sport of South Korea, it is regarded as the worldâ€™s most popular martial art, if measured by the number of 
			practitioners. Taekwondo is currently well known for its dynamic and fast kicking techniques, although it also involves a variety of other hand techniques as well. There are two styles
			of Taekwondo. The majority of UTTO practices the style which originates from the <em>Kukkiwon</em> and is governed by <strong>World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)</strong>. The other martial art style is governed by 
			the <strong>International Taekwondo Federation (ITF)</strong>. The two styles are technically and doctrinally different, but still retain many similarities.</p>
			<p>Taekwondo contains both <em>artistic</em> and <em>athletic</em> aspects. An important part of the artistic aspect are <strong>Poomsae</strong>, which literally means <em>"form"</em> or <em>"pattern"</em>. They are sequences of typical Taekwondo techniques.
			One of the main requirements of attaining a higher rank in Taekwondo belt tests is to demonstrate sufficient skill in performing the appropriate Poomsae. Poomsae are also often tested in competitions at many levels, including internationally.</p>
			<p>Under WTF rules, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is a <em>strategic, full contact</em> technical sport. A typical match usually involves two fully equipped competitors, one referee, 4 score keeping referees and a square ring 10 meters wide. 
			1 point is awarded for a proper kick to the chest, 2 points awarded for a successful kick to the head. Grappling and grabbing techniques are not allowed and are penalized if utilized. There are three 2-minute rounds per match under the 
			regulated time and the competitor with the most points after the 3 rounds wins the match. In the event of a tie, a fourth "sudden death" match will ensue. <br/>
