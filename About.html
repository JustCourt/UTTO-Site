					<p>The University of Toronto Taekwondo Organization (UTTO) was founded in 2006. Since its inauguration, UTTO has grown exponentially from a small group of Taekwondo enthusiasts to a large organization offering a wide range of classes for Taekwondoists of all levels. This includes instructional beginner and intermediate classes at the Athletic Centre (AC) taught by a black belt Taekwondo instructor and advance and competitive classes at Hart House for experienced Taekwondoists who either just want to keep training casually or are looking to train with a more competitive edge.
					The club currently has approximately 50 beginner and intermediate students and 30 advanced class members, 15 of who are on the U of T Taekwondo Competitive Team.
					The U of T Taekwondo Team is an unoffical club team that has had a lot of success at tournaments both in and out of province. In April 2009, U of T clinched the Ontario Universities Taekwondo Competitive League (OUTCL) inter-collegiate tournament, coming in first place overall. In November 2009, the U of T Taekwondo Team competed in Master Chong’s World Class Taekwondo Tournament at Buffalo State Collegein Buffalo, N.Y., UTTO’s first international competition. UTTO is currently working towards their goal of having Taekwondo become a varsity sport.
					UTTO is not only about learning and practicing Taekwondo. Believe it or not, we Taekwondoists like and know how to party (which is why we have not one, but two social directors). UTTO organizes numerous social events throughout the year, including pub nights, karaoke nights, Korean food outings, and our annual trip to Hart House Farm as a way to get to know fellow UTTO members and create a mini-UTTO family.</p>

				<p>What is Taekwondo?
				Taekwondo is a Korean martial art. In addition to being the national sport of South Korea, it is regarded as the world’s most popular martial art, if measured by the number of practitioners. Taekwondo is currently well known for its dynamic and fast kicking techniques, although it also involves a variety of other hand techniques as well. There are two styles of Taekwondo. The majority of UTTO practices the style which originates from the Kukkiwon and is governed by World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). The other martial art style is governed by the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF). The two styles are technically and doctrinal different, but still retain many similarities.
				The artistic aspect of Taekwondo:
				Poomsae literally means “form” or “pattern” and is a sequence of typical techniques from Taekwondo. In this way, it can be regarded as a pure continuous form of Taekwondo. One of the main requirements of attaining a higher rank in Taekwondo belt examinations is to demonstrate sufficient skill in performing the appropriate poomsae. Poomsaes are often tested in competitions and there also exists a world level poomsae competition.
				Olympic-style Taekwondo sparring:
				Under WTF rules, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is a strategic full contact technical sport. A typical match usually involves two fully equipped competitors, one referee, 4 score keeping referees and a square ring 10 meters wide. 1 point is awarded for a proper kick to the chest, 2 points awarded for a successful kick to the head. Grappling and grabbing techniques are not allowed and are penalized if utilized. There are three 2-minute rounds per match under the regulated time and the competitor with the most points after the 3 rounds wins the match. In the event of a tie, a fourth “sudden death” match will ensue.</p>
